# Workflows

Complete guide to creating, extending, and executing workflows in Titan CLI.

---

## Overview

Workflows are YAML files that declare a sequence of steps to execute. Each step calls a plugin step function, a shell command, or another workflow. The engine runs them in order, and each step returns a result that determines whether execution continues.

---

## YAML Structure

```yaml
name: "My Workflow"              # Required. Display name.
description: "What it does"     # Optional. Shown in the UI.

params:                          # Optional. Default values available in all steps via ctx.get()
  draft: false
  assignees: []

tags:                            # Optional. Arbitrary metadata (e.g. platform: android).
  platform: android              # Used by plugins for workflow filtering.

hooks:                           # Optional. Documents hook points for extension (see Extending Workflows)
  - before_commit
  - after_push

steps:
  - id: my_step                  # Optional. Auto-generated from name if omitted.
    name: "My Step"              # Optional. Display name.
    plugin: github               # Plugin providing the step.
    step: create_pr              # Step name registered by the plugin.
    on_error: continue           # Optional. "fail" (default) or "continue".
    requires:                    # Optional. Context variables that must exist in ctx.data
      - pr_title                 # before this step runs. Missing variable → step fails
      - pr_head_branch           # with an Error before executing.
    params:                      # Optional. Extra values merged into ctx.data for this step.
      draft: "${draft}"
```

---

## Step Types

A step must define exactly one action type:

### 1. Plugin Step

Calls a registered step function from a plugin.

```yaml
- id: fetch_pr
  name: "Fetch PR Data"
  plugin: github
  step: fetch_pull_request
```

**Special plugin values:**
- `plugin: project` → calls a step from `.titan/steps/` in the current project
- `plugin: user` → calls a step from `~/.titan/steps/`
- `plugin: core` → calls a built-in Titan step. Available core steps: `ai_code_assistant`. Note: core steps have a different signature — they receive `(step_config, ctx)` instead of just `(ctx)`.

### 2. Shell Command

Runs a shell command directly.

```yaml
- id: run_lint
  name: "Run Linter"
  command: "ruff check ."
  on_error: continue
```

Add `use_shell: true` if the command requires shell features (pipes, redirects). Avoid for untrusted input.

**Environment**: command steps inherit the user's console environment (same as typing the
command yourself). Titan-managed project secrets (`.titan/secrets.env`) are NOT part of it —
the vault keeps them in memory, never in `os.environ`. The resolved command echoed to the UI
(and the command output display) pass through the secret-redaction filter.

### 3. Nested Workflow

Calls another workflow as a step. The sub-workflow's result is returned to the parent.

```yaml
- id: commit_first
  name: "Commit Changes"
  workflow: "commit-ai"
```

**Two resolution modes:**

- **Without prefix** (`"commit-ai"`): resolved by source precedence (project → user → plugin). If a project has its own `commit-ai`, that one wins.
- **With prefix** (`"plugin:git/commit-ai"`): targets a specific plugin's workflow directly, bypassing precedence. Use this when you explicitly need the base workflow, not a project override.

```yaml
# Uses whichever commit-ai has highest precedence (e.g. project's extended version)
- workflow: "commit-ai"

# Always uses the base commit-ai from the git plugin, ignoring any project overrides
- workflow: "plugin:git/commit-ai"
```

This is especially useful in hooks where you want to call the base workflow without triggering a project's extended version of it.

---

## Parameters

Workflow-level `params` define defaults that all steps can access via `ctx.get("key")`.

Step-level `params` are merged into `ctx.data` before the step runs, overriding workflow-level values for that step.

**Variable substitution** uses `${key}` syntax to interpolate values from `ctx.data`:

```yaml
params:
  assignees: []

steps:
  - plugin: github
    step: create_issue
    params:
      assignees: "${assignees}"   # Resolved from ctx.data at runtime
      labels: "${labels}"
```

---

## Workflow Sources and Precedence

Titan discovers workflows from four sources. When the same workflow name exists in multiple sources, the **highest-precedence source wins**:

| Priority | Source | Location |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | Project | `.titan/workflows/*.yaml` |
| 2 | User | `~/.titan/workflows/*.yaml` |
| 3 | System | Bundled with Titan CLI |
| 4 (lowest) | Plugin | Bundled with each plugin |

This means a project workflow can override a plugin workflow of the same name.

---

## Extending Workflows (hooks)

A base workflow declares **hook points** — named injection points in its step sequence. An extending workflow injects additional steps at those points.

**How hook points are defined:** a hook point is a `- hook: <name>` marker step inside `steps`. The top-level `hooks:` list in a base workflow is documentation-only — the engine derives the available hooks from the `hook:` marker steps (see `_merge_steps_with_hooks` in `titan_cli/core/workflows/workflow_registry.py`). Keep the top-level list in sync with the markers for readability, but it's the markers that matter.

### Base workflow defines hooks

```yaml
# plugin:git/commit-ai
name: "Commit with AI"
description: "Create a commit with AI-generated message"

hooks:
  - before_commit    # ← documents the injection point (informational)

steps:
  - id: git_status
    name: "Check Git Status"
    plugin: git
    step: get_status

  - hook: before_commit   # ← actual injection point; steps injected here at runtime

  - id: diff_summary
    name: "Show Changes Summary"
    plugin: git
    step: show_uncommitted_diff_summary

  - id: ai_commit_message
    name: "AI Commit Message"
    plugin: git
    step: ai_generate_commit_message

  - id: create_commit
    name: "Create Commit"
    plugin: git
    step: create_commit

  - id: push
    name: "Push changes to remote"
    plugin: git
    step: push
```

### Extending workflow injects steps into hooks

```yaml
# .titan/workflows/commit-ai.yaml
name: "Commit with AI, Linter and Tests"
extends: "plugin:git/commit-ai"

hooks:
  before_commit:           # ← inject into this hook
    - id: run-lint
      name: "Run Linter"
      plugin: project
      step: ruff_linter
      on_error: continue

    - id: run-tests
      name: "Run Tests"
      plugin: project
      step: test_runner
      on_error: continue
```

**Extends syntax:**
- `"plugin:git/commit-ai"` → a specific plugin's workflow
- `"commit-ai"` → resolved by source precedence (any source)

**Implicit hook:** `after` is always available for appending steps at the very end, even if not declared in the base.

**Params:** overlay params are shallow-merged over base params (overlay wins on conflict).

## Step Result Types

Every step function returns one of four result types. The engine checks the type after each step to decide what to do next.

```python
from titan_cli.engine import Success, Error, Skip, Exit
```

### Execution Flow

```
Step returns:
  Success  →  merge metadata into ctx.data  →  continue to next step
  Skip     →  merge metadata into ctx.data  →  continue to next step
  Error    →  check on_error config         →  stop OR continue
  Exit     →  merge metadata into ctx.data  →  STOP entire workflow
```

### Success

Step completed. Workflow continues.

```python
return Success("PR created")
return Success("Branch created", metadata={"branch_name": "feat/my-feature"})
```

The `metadata` dict is automatically merged into `ctx.data` so subsequent steps can access it.

### Skip

Step had nothing to do, but the workflow should continue. Semantically different from `Success`: nothing happened, the step was not applicable.

```python
return Skip("AI not configured")
return Skip("No commits to push")
return Skip("Push cancelled by user", metadata={"push_successful": False})
```

Metadata is also merged into `ctx.data`.

### Error

Step failed. Behavior depends on `on_error` in the YAML:

| `on_error` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"fail"` (default) | Workflow stops immediately with an error |
| `"continue"` | Workflow continues to the next step |

```python
return Error("GitHub client not available")
return Error("API rate limit exceeded", code=429)
return Error("Connection failed", exception=exc)
```

### Exit

Stops the **entire workflow immediately**. Not an error — signals "the workflow is no longer needed". The engine converts it to `Success` for any parent workflow.

```python
return Exit("No changes to commit")       # Nothing to do
return Exit("No open PRs found")          # Workflow complete before doing anything
```

---

## Critical: Skip vs Exit

This is the most common mistake when writing steps.

**`Exit` stops ALL remaining steps**, including cleanup steps at the end of the workflow. Use it only when no resources have been allocated that need cleanup.

**`Skip` continues to the next step.** Use it for "nothing to do in this step, but keep going".

**Neither survives an abort.** If the user quits the TUI while a step is waiting — at a
prompt, or inside an AI or CLI call — the workflow thread is unwound with
`WorkflowAborted` and no later step runs, cleanup steps included. Anything that must
happen regardless belongs in a `finally` inside the step that allocated the resource.
See the `ask_*` section of [`textual.md`](textual.md) for why prompts abort rather than
answer with their default.

### ❌ Wrong — cleanup is skipped

```yaml
steps:
  - step: create_worktree     # Creates a worktree
    on_error: continue
  - step: do_work             # Returns Exit("nothing to do")  ← stops here
    on_error: continue
  - step: cleanup_worktree    # ← NEVER RUNS
```

```python
# do_work step
if not items:
    return Exit("Nothing to do")   # Stops the workflow — cleanup never runs!
```

### ✅ Correct — cleanup always runs

```python
# do_work step
if not items:
    return Skip("Nothing to do")   # Continues to cleanup_worktree
```

### Pattern: Guaranteed Cleanup

To guarantee a step always runs (e.g., cleanup):

1. **Use `on_error: continue`** on all preceding steps that might fail
2. **Use `Skip`** (not `Exit`) in intermediate steps when they have nothing to do
3. **Use `Exit`** only in early steps where no resources have been created yet

```yaml
steps:
  # Early steps: Exit is fine here (nothing created yet)
  - id: select_pr
    plugin: github
    step: select_pr_for_review
    # Exit here stops before any worktree is created — correct

  # After resource creation: all intermediate steps must use Skip, not Exit
  - id: create_worktree
    plugin: github
    step: create_worktree
    on_error: continue        # ← if this fails, still try to cleanup

  - id: do_work
    plugin: github
    step: review_comments     # ← must return Skip (not Exit) for "nothing to do"
    on_error: continue

  - id: push_commits
    plugin: github
    step: push_commits        # ← must return Skip (not Exit) when no commits
    on_error: continue

  - id: cleanup               # ← ALWAYS runs if above use Skip + on_error: continue
    plugin: github
    step: cleanup_worktree
```

---

## Step Function Signature

All step functions follow the same signature:

```python
from titan_cli.engine import WorkflowContext, WorkflowResult, Success, Error, Skip, Exit

def my_step(ctx: WorkflowContext) -> WorkflowResult:
    ...
```

**For project and user steps** (`plugin: project` / `plugin: user`), the function name must exactly match the `step:` field in the YAML. No `_step` suffix is needed — the function name IS the step name.

```python
# .titan/steps/my_step.py
def my_step(ctx: WorkflowContext) -> WorkflowResult:  # ← function name = step name
    ...
```

```yaml
- plugin: project
  step: my_step               # ← must match exactly
```

**Plugin steps** are different: they are mapped explicitly in the plugin's `get_steps()` dictionary, so the YAML `step:` name can differ from the function name. For example, the git plugin maps `"create_commit"` to `create_git_commit_step` in its `plugin.py`.

### Accessing context data

```python
pr_number = ctx.get("selected_pr_number")  # None if not set
pr_number = ctx.get("selected_pr_number", 0)  # With default
```

### Public step docstring convention

This convention is mandatory for any public step exposed through `plugin.py -> get_steps()`.

Public steps are part of the plugin's workflow API. Their docstrings are used as the source for semiautomated documentation inventory and validation.

Required section headers:

- `Requires:`
- `Inputs (from ctx.data):`
- `Outputs (saved to ctx.data):`
- `Returns:`

Rules:

1. `Returns:` is always required.
2. `Requires:` is required when the step depends on `ctx.git`, `ctx.github`, `ctx.jira`, `ctx.ai`, or other context-provided services.
3. `Inputs (from ctx.data):` is required when the step reads workflow data from `ctx.get(...)`.
4. `Outputs (saved to ctx.data):` is required when the step returns metadata that later steps consume.
5. Use these exact header names. Do not replace them with variants such as `Params:`, `Stores in:`, or `Output variables:`.
6. If the step can return `Skip` or `Exit`, document that explicitly in `Returns:`.

Template:

```python
def my_public_step(ctx: WorkflowContext) -> WorkflowResult:
    """
    One-line summary.

    Requires:
        ctx.github: An initialized GitHubClient.

    Inputs (from ctx.data):
        pr_number (int): Pull request number to inspect.

    Outputs (saved to ctx.data):
        pr_info: The fetched pull request object.

    Returns:
        Success: If the step completes successfully.
        Skip: If the step is not applicable.
        Error: If required context is missing or execution fails.
    """
```

Scope:

- Mandatory for plugin public steps exposed in `get_steps()`.
- Recommended for project steps under `.titan/steps/`.
- Optional for internal helpers that are not part of the public workflow API.

hooks:
  - after_review

steps:
  - id: select_pr
    name: "Select PR for Review"
    plugin: github
    step: select_pr_for_review
    # Exit here is fine — no branch switched yet

  - id: fetch_comments
    name: "Fetch Pending Comments"
    plugin: github
    step: fetch_pending_comments
    # Exit here is also fine — still on the original branch

  - id: check_clean_state
    name: "Check Branch State"
    plugin: github
    step: check_clean_state

  # Checkout PR branch (saves original branch for restore)
  - id: checkout_pr_branch
    name: "Checkout PR Branch"
    plugin: github
    step: checkout_pr_branch
    on_error: continue           # ← branch switched here; continue even on failure

  - id: review_comments
    name: "Review Comments"
    plugin: github
    step: review_comments        # ← returns Skip (not Exit) when user exits early
    on_error: continue

  # Hook point: inject linter, tests, or any validation before pushing
  - hook: after_review

  - id: push_commits
    name: "Push Commits"
    plugin: github
    step: push_commits           # ← returns Skip (not Exit) when no commits
    on_error: continue

  - id: send_replies
    name: "Send Comment Replies"
    plugin: github
    step: send_comment_replies   # ← returns Skip (not Exit) when no replies
    on_error: continue

  - id: request_review
    name: "Re-request Review"
    plugin: github
    step: request_review
    on_error: continue

  # Restore original branch ALWAYS runs
  - id: restore_branch
    name: "Restore Branch"
    plugin: github
    step: checkout_original_branch
```
