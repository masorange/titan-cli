Headless opencode auto-rejects any tool call its config maps to "ask" (it cannot
prompt without a TTY), and a rejection ends the run mid-plan with no answer —
observed live: a PR-description run died on `git log` and produced zero output.
The env var scopes the fix to Titan's own subprocess: the user's opencode.json
is never touched (it may be JSONC with comments, which a rewrite would destroy),
and interactive opencode sessions keep their own rules. Read-shaped git commands
are the whole reason Titan routes repo tasks to a CLI, so they are allowed;
edits and every other command stay denied while unattended. File reading and
code search tools are allowed by opencode's own defaults.

A denied tool call is only reported to the model after it commits to that plan,
