One rule covers all read-shaped work: agy gates listing, code search, and file
reads behind the single "read_file" permission (verified live — with only this
rule, list/search/read tools all run), and it prunes rule names it does not
recognize from the file on exit, so provisioning anything else would just be
re-added and re-pruned on every run. Read-only on purpose: write and command
tools stay unlisted, so agy keeps auto-denying them (or containing them to its
scratch sandbox) while unattended.
