# titan_cli/ai/agents/contracts.py
"""
Response contracts for AI agent calls.

A contract states the shape of answer one call needs and how to recover that
shape from whatever the model actually returned. It travels on the request
rather than on the agent class, because a single agent can make several calls
that each want a different answer.

The same contract runs on every transport. A provider able to enforce a JSON
schema natively is given one, but honoring it is an optimization and never a
guarantee - a CLI can return prose with a successful exit code - so parsing and
validation always run, schema or no schema.
