    in `enums.py` for the recommended vocabulary official plugins should
    reuse. `task` is never sent to the model; only the prompt is.

    `executes` is the set of provider types this step's code can actually
    run - preference UIs offer the user nothing outside it, and the resolver
    refuses a persisted preference that falls outside it rather than handing
    the step something it can't drive. `preferred` is the default try-order
    when the user configured nothing, always a subset of `executes` (the
    decorator enforces this at import time).
