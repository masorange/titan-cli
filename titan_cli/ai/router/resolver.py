"""
Route resolution for the AI execution routing layer.

Resolves which provider a task should use given persisted preferences
(`titan_cli.core.models.AIPreferences`) and provider availability
(`AIAvailabilityChecker`). Never picks a fallback silently: if a resolved
provider is unavailable, resolution reports that user input is needed instead
of guessing, regardless of how many compatible candidates remain.

The task is the only persisted preference scope. Resolution has exactly three
levels: a runtime override, the user's persisted preference for the task, and
the step's own declared `preferred` order.

Each of those levels answers only WHICH KIND of provider to use. Which concrete
connection or CLI serves that kind is a single global setting
(`AIConfig.default_connection` / `AIConfig.default_cli`), attached here so every
decision leaves this module naming the instance that will actually run.
