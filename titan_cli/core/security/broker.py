"""
Public secrets API for everything outside the trust boundary.

`SecretBroker` is what steps, plugins, and screens receive. It is created by
core with a namespace derived from the registered plugin/step identity — the
caller never chooses its own namespace — and it deliberately has no read
method: a secret can be stored, checked, or deleted, but the value itself
only ever leaves the boundary as an *effect* (an authenticated session, a
subprocess stdin, a scoped tempfile — see sessions.py and the use-primitives).
