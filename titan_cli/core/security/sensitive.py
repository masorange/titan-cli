"""
Opaque wrapper for sensitive material a plugin derives itself.

The broker's use-primitives protect secrets Titan custodies (keyring/env
values). But a plugin can *derive* new sensitive material from them — a GPG
passphrase decrypts a service-account JSON, for example — and that derived
material never passed through the vault, so nothing registers or guards it.
Protecting the passphrase does not protect what the passphrase unlocked.

`SensitiveValue` is the container for that material: it cannot be pickled,
deep-copied, or JSON-serialized (so it cannot leak into persisted state or
result metadata by accident), its `repr` never shows the payload, and string
payloads are registered for redaction. Access is explicit and greppable:
`.reveal()`.

Honest limits, same class as the rest of this package: this guards against
*accidental* exposure. Code that calls `.reveal()` holds the real value and
can do anything with it — and for container payloads (dicts, lists), only
long string leaves are registered for redaction (registering short generic
fragments like ``"service_account"`` would shred unrelated log output).
