"""
Titan's single trust boundary for secrets.

Only code inside this package may touch raw secret strings, the OS keyring,
or the private vault. Everything outside works with opaque `SecretRef`
handles and a `SecretBroker` that deliberately has no read API: a secret can
be stored, checked for existence, deleted, or *used* — never returned.

The boundary is enforced by an architecture test
(tests/core/security/test_architecture.py), not just by convention.
