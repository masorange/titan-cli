"""
Per-task AI routing: the widgets and the pure logic behind the "AI per task" and "CLI"
sections of the AI Configuration screen.

The unit a user configures is the TASK ("for commit messages, use X"), not the step, the
workflow or the plugin - those are how the setting is discovered, not how it is chosen. So
discovery output is aggregated by task here, and each row offers only KINDS of provider.
Which connection or CLI serves a kind is one global setting, set once in the CLI section and
in the connections grid.
