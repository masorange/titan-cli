# Git Plugin

The Git plugin adds core Git operations to Titan through a high-level client and reusable workflows. It covers branches, commits, status inspection, diffs, remotes, stashes, tags, and worktrees.

This page documents the plugin from a functional point of view, while also showing how each capability is called and which parameters it needs.

---

## Requirements

To use the Git plugin in a project:

- Enable the `git` plugin in `.titan/config.toml`
- Install the `git` CLI and make sure it is available in `PATH`
- Run Titan inside a Git repository

Example project configuration:

```toml
[plugins.git]
enabled = true

[plugins.git.config]
main_branch = "main"
default_remote = "origin"
```

---

## Accessing the client

In Titan code, the public entry point is the Git plugin client:

```python
git_plugin = config.registry.get_plugin("git")
client = git_plugin.get_client()
```

The client returns `ClientResult[...]` values. In practice, this means each call can succeed with data or return an error result.

## Related workflows

The Git plugin ships with workflows that use these capabilities directly:

- `commit-ai`: Checks repository status, shows a summary of local changes, generates a commit message with AI, creates the commit, and pushes it

These workflows can be used as-is or extended from `.titan/workflows/`.
