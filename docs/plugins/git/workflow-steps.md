# Git Workflow Steps

The Git plugin exposes reusable public workflow steps through `GitPlugin.get_steps()`. These steps are grouped here by workflow intent so authors can discover related building blocks more easily.

For full contract details for every public step, including documented inputs, outputs, and return behavior, see the [detailed step reference](../generated/git-step-reference.md).

## Functional groups

- [Status and Inspection](#status-and-inspection)
- [Commits](#commits)
- [Branching](#branching)
- [Diff Summaries](#diff-summaries)
- [Worktrees](#worktrees)

## Status and Inspection

Use these steps to inspect repository state and expose branch metadata to later steps.

- `get_status`: retrieve repository status and expose `git_status` to the workflow context
- `get_current_branch`: resolve the currently checked out branch name
- `get_base_branch`: resolve the base branch used by Git workflows

## Commits

Use these steps to prepare commit content and publish branch changes.

- `create_commit`: create a commit from workflow commit message data
- `push`: push the current branch to the configured remote
- `ai_generate_commit_message`: generate a commit message from local changes using AI

## Branching

Use these steps to switch, create, and restore branches during a workflow.

- `save_current_branch`: save the current branch in workflow context
- `restore_original_branch`: restore the saved branch later in the workflow
- `checkout`: switch to a branch from workflow context or params
- `pull`: update the current branch from the configured remote
- `create_branch`: create a new branch from workflow-provided branch data

## Diff Summaries

Use these steps when a workflow needs human-readable or AI-friendly summaries of Git changes.

- `show_uncommitted_diff_summary`: summarize local uncommitted changes
- `show_branch_diff_summary`: summarize branch-level changes relative to the base branch

## Worktrees

Use these steps to isolate workflow work in dedicated worktrees.

- `create_worktree`: create a worktree for isolated work
- `remove_worktree`: remove a worktree when finished
- `worktree_commit`: commit changes inside a specific worktree
- `worktree_push`: push a branch from a specific worktree

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED STEP CONTRACTS -->
## Detailed Step Contracts

The summaries above show what each git step is for. The sections below show the documented contract for each public step: what it expects from `ctx.data`, what it saves back, and what result types it may return.

Expand a step to see its workflow usage, required context, inputs, outputs, and result behavior.

How to read these contracts:

- `Inputs (from ctx.data)` = values the step expects before it runs.
- `Outputs (saved to ctx.data)` = metadata keys saved for later steps when the step returns `Success` or `Skip`.
- `Returns` = the workflow result type (`Success`, `Skip`, `Error`, `Exit`), not a separate payload.

## Docstring-based reference

The semiautomated step inventory reads public step docstrings from code and validates that each exposed step documents:

- `Requires`
- `Inputs (from ctx.data)` when applicable
- `Outputs (saved to ctx.data)` when applicable
- `Returns`

The generated machine-readable inventory lives under `docs/plugins/_generated/`.

For this project, the inventory is maintained through:
