CommentView Widget

Unified widget for displaying a single comment with code context.

Handles three comment types seamlessly:
  - Inline review comments (has path + line + diff_hunk)
  - General PR comments (no code context → shows a "General PR comment" badge)
  - AI review suggestions (has severity badge, file path, diff context)

Does NOT include action buttons — that is the caller's responsibility.
