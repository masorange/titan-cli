    Make ``worktree_path`` reusable, whatever state a previous run left it in.

    Three residues can block ``git worktree add`` on the same path, and they need
    different remedies, so all three are attempted in order:

    1. A live registered worktree — ``git worktree remove --force`` handles it.
    2. A leftover directory git commands can't touch (unregistered, or ``remove``
       failed on it) — ``add`` refuses a non-empty path, so it is deleted directly.
    3. Stale metadata under ``.git/worktrees`` — only ``git worktree prune`` clears
       it, and prune only acts on entries whose directory is MISSING, so it must
       run after the directory removal, not before.

    Best-effort by design: every step is optional cleanup, so failures are ignored
    and the caller proceeds to creation, which reports the real error if any residue
    survived.
