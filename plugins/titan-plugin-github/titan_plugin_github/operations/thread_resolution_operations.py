For each thread, you have:
- The original reviewer comment
- All replies from the PR author and other reviewers
- The current state of the code near the commented line (if available)

## Open Threads

{threads_text}

## Your Task

For each thread, decide one of the following actions:

- **resolved**: The author's changes or replies have fully addressed the issue. The thread can be marked as resolved. Use this when:
  - The code hunk shows the problem has been fixed
  - The author acknowledged and applied the fix
  - The concern is no longer relevant due to code changes
  - The original issue is gone

- **insist**: The issue still exists in the code. The author's reply did not address it. Post a follow-up comment explaining why the problem persists.

- **reply**: The concern is partially addressed or needs clarification/acknowledgment. The author's approach seems right but needs:
  - Minor tweaks or explanations
  - Acknowledgment that the fix was applied
  - Clarification on edge cases

- **skip**: The thread is not actionable now (out of scope, already agreed to fix later, administrative discussion, etc.)

## Critical Rules:

1. **NEVER use "reply" or "insist" with empty or whitespace-only body**. If you have nothing substantive to say, use "resolved" or "skip".
2. Base decisions on **actual code shown**, not assumptions.
3. If code hunk shows the fix applied → **resolved** (suggested_reply: null)
4. If author replied but problem still visible in code → **insist** (with detailed explanation of why it's still broken)
5. If you need confirmation or minor fixes → **reply** (with specific, actionable request)
6. `suggested_reply` is MANDATORY when decision is "insist" or "reply":
   - Must be non-empty (at least 10 characters of actual content, not whitespace)
   - Must be a complete, ready-to-post GitHub comment
   - Can reference the author's changes or code
7. `suggested_reply` must be null when decision is "resolved" or "skip"
8. If you cannot think of a substantive reply, change decision to "resolved"

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array matching this exact schema for each element:
{schema}

Return ONLY the JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences."""
