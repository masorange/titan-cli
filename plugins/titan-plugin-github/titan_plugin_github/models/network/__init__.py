"""
GitHub Network Models

Network models represent data exactly as it comes from GitHub APIs:
- rest/: Models from REST API (gh CLI JSON responses)
- graphql/: Models from GraphQL API

These models are faithful to API responses with no transformations.
Use mappers to convert to view models for UI rendering.
