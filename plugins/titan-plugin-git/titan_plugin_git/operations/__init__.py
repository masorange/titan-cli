Pure business logic functions that can be used in steps or called programmatically.
All functions here are UI-agnostic and can be unit tested independently.

Modules:
    commit_operations: Operations for commit message handling
    diff_operations: Operations for diff parsing and formatting
    branch_operations: Operations for branch management
